# PROST: A quantitative pattern recognition framework for spatial transcriptomics 
## Overview
`PROST` is a flexible framework to quantify gene spatial expression patterns and detect spatial tissue domains using spatially resolved transcriptomics with various resolutions. `PROST` consists of two independent workflows: **PROST Index (PI)** and **PROST Neural Network (PNN)**.

Using `PROST` you can do:
* Quantitative identification of spatial patterns of gene expression changes by the proposed **PROST Index (PI)**.

* Unsupervised identification of spatial tissue domains using a **PROST Neural Network (PNN)**.
