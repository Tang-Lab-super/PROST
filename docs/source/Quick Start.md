# Quick Start
* After `PROST` installation, we suggest downloading the complete tutorial examples from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7827565.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7827565) (The dataset is too large to upload to github, there only 1 case (151672) of DLPFC data).   
Similarly, you can download the dataset for each turorial individually via the `google drive` below. After you have downloaded the folder, unzip it and move the files to the datasets.

* Before running the tutorial, make sure your current path is in `/PROST-master/test`. **This facilitates you to perform PROST tests quickly.** In this folder, `data` in `datasets` and `result` will be stored under the corresponding data folder `results`. 

        cd ./test

For more flexibility, you may need to modify the `rootdir` to make sure the paths are correct.
