# PROST: A quantitative pattern recognition framework for spatial transcriptomics 
## Overview
`PROST` is a flexible framework to quantify gene spatial expression patterns and detect spatial tissue domains using spatially resolved transcriptomics with various resolutions. `PROST` consists of two independent workflows: **PROST Index (PI)** and **PROST Neural Network (PNN)**.

Using `PROST` you can do:
* Quantitative identification of spatial patterns of gene expression changes by the proposed **PROST Index (PI)**.

* Unsupervised identification of spatial tissue domains by using a **PROST Neural Network (PNN)**.

## Installation
### 1. Prepare `Python` environment
To install `PROST`, we recommend using the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python Distribution and creating an isolated environment, so that the `PROST` and dependencies don't conflict or interfere with other packages or applications. Please install the `conda` in advance. 


### Create environment 
First, please download or clone the `PROST-master.zip` file from github `Code` and unzip it. 

    git clone https://github.com/Tang-Lab-super/PROST.git

The entire installation process takes place in the `PROST-master` directory, so first go to that directory by:
   
    cd PROST-master

We recommend using a conda environment to configure PROST. To create the environment, run the following command in `bash` or `Anaconda Powershell Prompt`:

    conda create -n PROST_ENV python=3.7


You can activate the `PROST_ENV` environment by: 

    conda activate PROST_ENV

### Install dependency package 
**a.** If you want to install `PROST` in `Linux` environment, you can install the dependency package using `pip` by:
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt

**b.** If you want to install `PROST` in `Windows` environment, you can install the dependency package using `pip` by:

    pip install -r requirements_win.txt
    pip install rpy2-2.9.5-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

### 2. Prepare `R` environment
The `PROST` uses the `mclust` package in the `R` language environment, and links it in a `Python` environment via `rpy2`. You can install the `R` language environment under `PROST_ENV` environment by:

    conda install r-base=4.0
    conda install r-mclust==5.4.10

### 3. Install `PROST`
Install the `PROST` package under `PROST_ENV`environment by:

    pip install setuptools==58.2.0
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

Here, the environment configuration is completed! 

### 4. How to use `PROST`
Before you can use `PROST`, you have to make sure that the following two steps are taken:  
* `PROST_ENV` environment is activated; 
* Add `environment variables` using the following `python code` before using `PROST`：

        import os
        ENVpath = "your path of PROST_ENV"  
        os.environ['R_HOME'] = f'{ENVpath}/lib/R'
        os.environ['R_USER'] = f'{ENVpath}/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rpy2'

**Note: using `conda info -e` can get `your path of PROST_ENV`.**

## Turorials
### Quick Start
* After `PROST` installation, we suggest downloading the complete tutorial examples from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7824815.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7824815)(The dataset is too large to upload to github)

* Our tutorial code is pre-written to run under `./test`, you have to change the path to `./test` and also place the downloaded datasets in `./test/datasets` so that you can get the results of the run in `./test/results`. For more flexibility, you may need to modify the `input_dir, output_dir and spatial_dir ` to make sure the paths are correct.
