# PROST (Pattern Recognition Of Spatial Transcriptomics)
`PROST` is a flexible framework to quantify gene spatial expression patterns and detect spatial tissue domains using spatially resolved transcriptomics with various resolutions. PROST consists of two independent workflows: PROST Index (PI) and PROST Neural Network (PNN). 

Using `PROST` you can do:
* Quantitative identification of spatial patterns of gene expression changes by the proposed PROST index (PI).

* Unsupervised identification of spatial domains of ST data by using a PROST Neural Network (PNN).
